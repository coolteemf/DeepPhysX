## Features review

This repository contains examples focused on training a Fully Connected Network to predict the mean value of a vector. 
The same application is implemented in CORE examples, this is the SOFA compatible version of the application.
These examples illustrate the main features of DeepPhysX framework.

> :warning: **PyTorch usage**: This working session uses the Fully Connected implementation from DeepPhysX_Torch package, 
please make sure it is installed if you want to run training scripts. 
Otherwise, you can download training data and / or trained network by running ___.
