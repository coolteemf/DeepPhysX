## Tutorials

This repository contains Python scripts to discover step by step the basic usage
of DeepPhysX. This tutorial only defines dummy objects so that users become 
familiar with the API and what is required to run training and prediction 
sessions.

### Description

Python scripts should be explored in the following order:
* **#01** `Environment.py`: how to define an Environment
* **#02** `Network.py`: how to define a Network
* **#03** `Configuration.py`: how to configure Environment, Network and Dataset
* **#04** `DataGeneration.py`: how to only generate a Dataset
* **#05** `OfflineTraining.py`: how to launch a training session with an existing dataset
* **#06** `OnlineTraining.py`: how to generate a Dataset and launch a training session simultaneously
* **#07** `Prediction.py`: how to launch a prediction session with a trained Network
