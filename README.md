## DeepPhysX

### Interfacing AI with simulation

The **DeepPhysX** project provides Python packages allowing users to easily interface their **numerical simulations**
with **learning algorithms**.

**DeepPhysX** provides a **Core** package with no dependency on any **simulation** or **AI** framework.
Then other modules are compatible with this **Core** and a specific **simulation** or **AI** framework.


### Quick install

The project was initially developed using [SOFA](https://www.sofa-framework.org/) as the **simulation package** and
[PyTorch](https://pytorch.org/) as the **AI framework**. 
Thus, **DeepPhysX** is mainly designed for these frameworks, but obviously **other frameworks** can also be used.
The packages corresponding to these frameworks will therefore be used for the default installation.
For further instructions, please refer to the **documentation**.

``` bash
$ git clone https://github.com/mimesis/deepphysx.git
$ cd DeepPhysX
$ pip install .
```
